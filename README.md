# Bayesian-opt
MLSALT4 Project 

This is an implementation of the paper Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms. Three experiments were carried out: optimizing Branin-Hoo function; logistic regression on MNIST dataset; Bayesian neural network on MNIST dataset.

Code for running experiments are in folders: Experiment_BH, Experiment_LR, Experiment_BN, respectively.
